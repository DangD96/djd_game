#### Description:
To celebrate the return of the [Bleach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(TV_series)#Thousand-Year_Blood_War) anime, I will be creating a "shooting" game. The player will control Ichigo (the main character) and attempt to defeat the enemy (Uryu). The enemy will fire arrows at the player and if the player loses all their health, the game is over. The enemy moves faster than the player. When the player's health is 2 or less, they can power up (Bankai). The player's movement speed and damage output will increase.
